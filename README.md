# My personal website

This repo has the sources of my personal website. It uses the [markchongo.js](https://github.com/santiago-iturriaga/markchongo.js) framework and the awesome [bib-publication-list](https://github.com/vkaravir/bib-publication-list).

### You can see a live version of the web [here](http://www.fing.edu.uy/~renzom/).

Feel free to use it as a template for your own website.
