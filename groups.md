## Department of Transport

**Department of Transport, Structures and Transport Institute, Faculty of Engineering, Universidad de la República, Uruguay**

[Group website (in spanish)](https://www.fing.edu.uy/iet/departamentos/depto-de-transporte)

I work as a teaching and research assistant at the Department of Transport. We are a small group of young researchers with different academic backgrounds. Our main interests include the analysis of public transport and socioeconomical data to evaluate QoS offered to citizens by the public transport system.

Team members: Matías Gutiérrez, Juan Pablo González

Collaborations: Martín Hansz, Joselina Davyt

We focus on the design of innovative methods for artificial intelligence and their application to complex real world problems. Our activity is currently mainly focused on optimization (continuous, combinatorial, single- and multi-objective, exact algorithms, metaheuristics, parallelism), machine learning (SVMs, deep learning), sustainable computing (autonomous programming, automatic generation of energy-efficient SW, efficient resources management), and intelligent transportation systems.

Team members:

* Bernabé DORRONSORO, PhD - HEAD of the lab
* Patricia RUIZ, PhD
   Conducts research in smart and sustainable mobility, mobile networks, and optimization.
* Santiago ITURRIAGA, PhD (2014 - 2017)
   Investigates on new efficient resource allocation methods for the cloud, computational grids, and datacenters.
* Juan Carlos de la TORRE, PhD student (2017 - )
   Researches on the design of new tools for the automatic transformation of SW for improved efficiency, both in terms of computation time and energy consumption.
* Alejandro SANTIAGO, PhD student (2015 - )
   Works on the design of novel highly-accurate metaheuristics for multi- and many-objective optimization.
* Renzo MASSOBRIO, PhD student (2016 - )
   Focuses on the design of new artificial intelligence methods to allow computers learning to solve complex optimization problems and autonomously generating parallel and energy efficient SW.
* Carlos SOTO, PhD student (2016 - )
   Works on the design of highly efficient parallel exact algorithms to find optimal solutions to complex multi-objective optimization problems.
